How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

     it shows me only the difference between them so that i can find the bug quickly and easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

     if you have any problem in your current code you can easily go back for your old working code
     and also you can compare it with the new one to see the difference and find the bug quickly

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

     manually committing let you control when to save your work so that decrease
     the number of unwanted saved versions whereas if you forget to commit you may lose your work
     and vice versa for the automatically approach

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    it depends on the type of files that being saved on the version control system and
    are they related to each other or not

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    with git log you can see all the commits history with their info such as id, time and commit message.
    with git diff you see the difference between two commits
    
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    just do not forget committing :)
    then you can switch between your commits easily using git checkout (commit id)

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for my android studio projects
